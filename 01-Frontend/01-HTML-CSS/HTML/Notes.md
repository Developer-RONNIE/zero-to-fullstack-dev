# <div align="center"> HTML </div>



### Introduction
**History:** HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was first created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 and is the standard language used to create and structure web pages.  
**Use:** It provides the *skeleton* of a webpage â€” defining headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and overall page structure.  


###  Live Server Extension 
Install the VS Code Live Server extension â†’ Open your HTML file â†’ Right-click â†’ Select **"Open with Live Server"** â†’ The page automatically opens in your default browser and refreshes whenever you save changes. Perfect for live preview while coding.  


### index.html
**Boilerplate:** The main file that contains the structure of your webpage.  
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser this is an HTML5 document.  
- `<html>` is the root container for all content.  
- `<head>` stores metadata like title, stylesheets, and scripts (not directly visible on the page).  
- `<title>` defines the page title (shown in browser tab).  
- `<body>` holds everything that is visible on the webpage â€” text, images, buttons, etc.  


### HTML Basics
### HTML Basics  

- `<>` â†’ Angle brackets used to write HTML tags which tell the browser what each piece of content means.  
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` â†’ Ensures the browser renders the page using the latest HTML5 standards.  
- `<html>` â†’ The outermost container for the webpage.  
- `<head>` â†’ Contains meta info, links to CSS/JS, and SEO info â€” does not display on the page.  
- `<title>` â†’ Sets the page title in the browser tab and is important for SEO.  
- `<body>` â†’ Holds everything you actually see â€” text, headings, links, images, etc.  
- `<h1>`â€“`<h6>` â†’ Heading tags, where `<h1>` is the largest/most important and `<h6>` is the smallest.  
- `<br>` â†’ Adds a single line break â€” good for breaking lines inside a paragraph.  
- `<hr>` â†’ Inserts a horizontal line â€” useful for separating sections.  
- `<p>` â†’ Creates a paragraph of text with some space before/after.  
- `lorem` â†’ VS Code shortcut (`lorem10`, `lorem30`) to generate dummy text for testing layouts.  
- `<pre>` â†’ Displays preformatted text exactly as written (keeps spaces, tabs, line breaks).  
- `<!-- comment -->` â†’ Notes for developers, ignored by the browser â€” great for leaving reminders.

### ðŸ“‚ Project : 
**Task:** Create a new HTML page called `lyrics.html` â†’ Add a heading with the song title (`<h1>`), break lines (`<br>`) between verses, add a horizontal line (`<hr>`) between chorus and verses, and use comments to mark sections.  
This project will help practice real-world HTML structure and make you comfortable writing and formatting HTML.
