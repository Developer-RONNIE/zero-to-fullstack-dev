### ‚ö†Ô∏è What is HTML ? 
- Every modern business maintains some form of online presence, which is typically delivered through the web. 
- `HTML` stands for `HyperText Markup Language`. It is the standard language used to structure content on the web. 
- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Langauge
- The core idea behind HTML is the use of `tags` (also called `markup`) to instruct the web browser on how content should be displayed. These tags define the meaning and structure of `elements` such as `headings`, `paragraphs`, `images`, `links`, and more. 

To start working with HTML, you will need:
‚≠ê A `modern web browser` (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge) to view and test your web pages.
‚≠ê A `code editor` (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom) to write and edit your HTML code.
